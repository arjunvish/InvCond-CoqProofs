After submission:
- bvshl_neq_ltr
- bvshr_ugt_rtl
- Get ICs for neg and subt rows.
- Prove IEs over neg and subt.
- Add >=u to the library.
- Equivalence between <=u and ~>u.
- IEs over predicates <=u and >=u.
- Equivalence between >=u and ~<u.
- Equivalence between bvashr and bvashr_a.
- Proving stuff about dependent types is hard due to Coq's unification algorithm. Read up on this.
- Try to replace BVList.v with BVList2.v.
- Look through Burak's proofs/finish written proofs.
